      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h3> ASPIRING WEB DESIGNER, UX ENTHUSIAST, PROBLEM SOLVER, & INVENTIVE SEAMSTRESS.</h3>
      <p>My wide variety of meandering career paths landed me at a small university in the middle of Indiana. There I took classes to achieve a coveted bachelor's degree. I was happily derailed when I took a beginning computer science class. We created a resume in HTML and I was hooked. Since then I have learned a lot of self-taught code and am working through a Skillcrush Blueprint in Front End Development.</p>
      <p>I have worked in a huge variety of jobs and amassed a great variety of skills. None, however, gave me the thrill of coding. To me, coding is like a puzzle or pieces of fabric that you need to figure out how to place to create something spectacular! I'm happiest when I'm creating something and working at creating websites is play for me.</p>
